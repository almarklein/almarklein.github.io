# Code

This is an overview of projects that I work on (or have worked on).


<div style='clear: both;'></div>
## Pyzo

<img style="float: right" src="images/pyzologo128.png" />

[Pyzo](https://github.com/pyzo/pyzo) is a cross-platform Python IDE focused on
interactivity and introspection, which makes it very suitable for
scientific computing. We have developed Pyzo to have a simplistic design
while still providing a powerful programming environment; all the good
stuff, without the clutter.

Pyzo is my longest running project. I've not been able to work
on it very actively lately, but I am still eager to bring this project to a
next level.



## Visualization

<img style="float: right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/almarklein/visvis/images/overviewScreen.png" width="300px"/>

My first visualization library, [Visvis](https://github.com/almarklein/visvis), is a pure Python library for visualization of 1D to 4D data in an object oriented way. Visvis is mature, though a bit idiosyncratic. I am not actively developing it anymore except fixing bugs and implementing small features.

In 2012 I founded the [Vispy](https://github.com/vispy/vispy/) project together with Luke Campagnola Nicolas Rougier, and Cyrille Rossant. It was purposed to replace each of our own projects, including Visvis. However, we've made the scope too big and all of us left for various reasons before it was finished. David Hoese heroically maintained the project for many years.

In 2020 I started working on a new viz stack based on [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) (which wraps Vulkan, Matal and DX12). We're building a Python wrapper, [wgpu-py](https://github.com/pygfx/wgpu-py/), on top of which we build a 3D render engine: [pygfx](https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx). The plan is for this to become one of the backends for a new high level API for vispy.

The [jupyter_rfb](https://github.com/vispy/jupyter_rfb) library provides a way for the above
visualization libraries to show figures in Jupyter lab/notebook.


## TimeTagger

<img style="float: right" width=96 src="images/timetagger192_sf.png" />

[TimeTagger](https://timetagger.app/) is an open source time tracking app, with a focus for [devs](https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger); it has a public web API, and a [CLI tool](https://github.com/almarklein/timetagger_cli). Grown out of frustration with existing solutions, a drive to create something refreshing, and an attempt to generate passive income.

## Web backend

As I started to gain an interest for the web, I've created several web
sites and apps (e.g. TimeTagger). From this work, several open source projects have spawned. The website that you're
visiting now is using all of the below :)

[Asgineer](https://github.com/almarklein/asgineer) is a truely
minimalistic async web framework based on the awesome
[uvicorn](https://github.com/encode/uvicorn). It allows one to create bloody
fast web servers that are easy to maintain.

[Fastuaparser](https://github.com/almarklein/fastuaparser) is a small utility
to parse user-agent strings, focussed on speed.

[ItemDB](https://github.com/almarklein/itemdb) is a small library that
provides a simple API to store and retrieve (JSON-compatible) Python
dicts in an SQLite database.

[MyPaas](https://github.com/almarklein/mypaas) is a tool to manage a
PaaS using Traefik and Docker, e.g. to run multiple websites.

## Python in the browser

<img style="float: right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zoofIO/flexx/master/flexx/resources/flexx.ico" width="128px"/>

[PScript](https://github.com/flexxui/pscript) is a Python to JavaScript compiler,
enabling writing JavaScript using a Python syntax, and handling several (but not
all) JavaScript pitfalls.

[Flexx](https://github.com/flexxui/flexx)
is a pure Python toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces
(GUIâ€™s), that uses PScript and web technology for its rendering. You
can use Flexx to create desktop applications, web applications, and (if
designed well) export an app to a standalone HTML document. It also
works in the Jupyter notebook.

Flexx is very powerful, but it turns out to be easy to create code with
it that becomes hard to maintain, because its so easy to mix real Python
with Python that runs in the browser (PScript). This makes these tools less
suited for wide adoption.

## Imageio

<img style="float: right" src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3678179?v=2&s=150" width="150px"/>

[Imageio](https://github.com/imageio/imageio) aims to support reading
and writing a wide range of image data, including animated images,
volumetric data, and scientific formats. It is designed to be powerful,
yet simple in usage and installation. It is also easy to extend new
formats to imageio.

The [imageio-ffmpeg](https://github.com/imageio/imageio-ffmpeg) project
is a spin-off of imageio, to handle the task of reading and writing
videos.

Imageio is a mature library and plugins keep getting improved/added.
It's used as a basis in e.g. scikit-image and Visvis.

## Image registration

[PyElastix](https://github.com/almarklein/pyelastix) is a project that has spun out of the PIRT project. It provides a Pythonic interface to the awesome Elastix image registration toolkit. I created this (pure Python) library to enable people to do image registration in a simple way, while making it easy to maintain.

PIRT, the [Python Image Registration Toolkit](https://bitbucket.org/almarklein/pirt), is a project to make powerful image registration algorihms easily accessible. It wraps PyElastix and also includes custom algorithms, including a diffeomorphic version of the Demons algorithm. Originally written in Cython, but now that it uses Numba it is pure Python (i.e. much easier to install).


<div style='clear: both;'></div>
## Stentseg

[Stentseg](https://bitbucket.org/almarklein/stentseg) is a library to perform segmentation of stent grafts in CT data. Mostly developed during my PhD, but in a rather good state. I managed to make it Pure Python by moving a critical part (a specific variant of the MPC algorithm) to scikit-image.


<div style='clear: both;'></div>
## BSDF

The [Binary Structured Data Format](https://gitlab.com/almarklein/bsdf) (BSDF) is an open
specification for serializing (scientific) data, for the purpose of
storage and (inter process) communication. It's designed to be a simple
format, making it easy to implement in many programming languages.
However, the format allows implementations to support powerful mechanics
such as lazy loading of binary data, and streamed reading/writing.
BSDF is a binary format; by giving up on human readability, BSDF can
be simple, compact and fast.
