# Consulting & Training

### Consulting 

Please contact me if you think I can help in a project. These can range
from longer running projects (subject to availability) or smaller
contract work (including e.g. features for an OSS project).


### Training / teaching

About twice a year I teach a 3 day [Scientific
Python](http://pythontwente.nl) course at the University of Twente,
targeted at employees and PhD students, but also open for external students.
I can also provide on-site training, ranging from beginners courses to
advanced (or specific) topics.
