Hi, this website is about my adventures in software and programming. I'm also into woodworking, mountainbiking, kidsraising, husbanding, and finding out what I want to be when I grow up.


### Values that drive me

Programming should be fun.

Good programming tools should be available to everyone.

Divide your criticism equally between new ideas and your current assumptions.

In the end, all what matters is our humanity.


### Experience and interests

I have been programming in Python since 2008 and am also adept in (vanilla) JavaScript. I have an interest in (3D) visualization, user interaction, web technology (front and back), and WebAssembly. I am not a designer, as is demonstrated by the appearance of this website.

### Career

I studied electrical engineering, followed by a PhD in medical image
analysis (to motions of stent grafts in vivo). During my PhD (2007-2011) I needed
tools for 3D visualization and data analysis. I fell in love with
Python, but not everything I needed was available, which is why I set
out to build some tools myself. I found building these (open source)
tools very satisfying, and since then I have been trying to make a
living with doing that. Since 2015 I work as a freelance software
engineer, which allows me to combine [paid work](consulting) with OSS maintenance
and experimenting with new technology (preferably a combination of these).
