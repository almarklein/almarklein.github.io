# Science does not have to be reproducible (unless it does)

There is a increasing demand for reproducible science, and this is a
good thing.

In an earlier post I argue that research is not true science if its not
reproducible, but after thinking about it more I now believe this is not true.

Research does not *need* to be reproducible by others in order to be called "science".


Imagine a group of people on an island, which is isolated from the rest
of the world. No knowledge comes in or out. The people on the island
are seeking knowledge for the benefit of their people. They do not share
data, code or results with the outside world, but surely you will agree
that what they do is true science.

Now imagine that these people *do* have interactions with the rest of
the world, and in fact share their results (but not data nor code). You
can imagine that people from outside the island may even benefit,
altough they cannot reproduce and thus verify these results.

So where does this change?

Now imagine that the people on the island are paid with public money from
the rest of the world.
