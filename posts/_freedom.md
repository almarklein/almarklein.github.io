## Freedom

Many decisions that we make are based upon information from others.
Not rarely this information is provided by parties that are not fully
honest for various reasons. They provide us with false or incomplete
information to influence us in a certain way. And this inhibits our freedom.

One example is how the tabacco industry has made vast amounts of money
off people who did not know that the smoke was killing them. This is
of course an extreme example, but the providing of misinformations
happens all the time (though often in more subtle ways).

It should be much more common to analyse the data ourselves and
make informed decicions based on the results. This means that we need
powerful and simple to use tools, as well as a shift to a culture where
we only believe something if we've seen it ourselves.
